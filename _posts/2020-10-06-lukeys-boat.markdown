Romans 15: 13    May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope, by the 
power of the Holy Spirit.

Last week, I introduced you to my place of birth.  This week, a little about its culture

The song, Lukey's Boat is a famous song from Newfoundland and Labrador.  Search for it on YouTube.  Choirs, folk musicians, all sorts have a version.    Go on, have a listen.

Here's the lyrics,
Lukey's boat is painted green, aha me b'ys, Lukey's boat is painted green, 
the prettiest boat you have ever seen.  
Aha, aha me riddle I day.

Lukey's boat got a fine for cutty, aha, me b'ys, Lukey's boat got a fine for cutty 
and every seam is pitched with putty.
Aha, aha me riddle I day.

Lukey's boat got high stop sails, aha, me b'ys, Lukey's boat got high stop sails
and she was planked with copper nails.  
Aha, aha me riddle I day.

I think says Lukey, I'll make her bigger, aha me b'ys, I think says Lukey I'll make her bigger, 
I'll load her down with a one claw jigger.  
Aha, aha me riddle I day

Lukey's rolling out his grub, aha me b'ys. Lukey's rolling out his grub, 
one split pea in a ten-pound tub.  
Aha, aha me riddle I day.

Aha says Lukey, the blinds are down, aha me b'ys, aha says Lukey the blinds are down,
me wife is dead and underground.  
Aha, aha me riddle I day.

Aha says Lukey I don't care, aha me b'ys. Aha, says Lukey, I don't care,
I'll get me another in the spring of the year.  
Aha, aha me riddle I day. 

And then the first verse is repeated. 

When you listen to the song, with its bright and bouncy tune, you may miss out on the lyrics.  Lukey is having a hard go of
it.  His boat might be pretty, but it is as sea worthy as a colander.  He has no money to make it any bigger.  He has one 
dried split pea to go into a container that can hold ten pounds of food.  And he has lost his love.  

Yep. Lukey is definitely having a hard time of it.  But clearly Lukey lives by the adage, you might as well laugh at it
than cry at it.

The song is beloved where I come from because we understand that if there is humour there is hope.  You do not deny where
you are nor what your experiences are, but you find hope to keep on going, God willing and the weather.  

Now I don't necessarily mean, "the President of Conference, District Chair and a senior church steward walked into synod,"
which might be the beginning of a really good joke which might indeed lift your spirits.  I mean the stories, the songs, 
the Lukey's boats which say, yep, we live in challenging times but it will not destroy us.  We will not give into despair.  There is always hope, for there is good and there is God and there is the Holy Spirit's lively dance.

This then, is my prayer for you this week and every week.

May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope, by the power of the Holy
Spirit.
