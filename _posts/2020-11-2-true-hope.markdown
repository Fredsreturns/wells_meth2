The Prophet Micah said this in Micah 6:8  
God has told you, O mortal what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, 
and to walk humbly with your God?

Micah was dealing with people who were saying one thing and doing another.  In Matthew 23, we have Jesus struggling with 
the same issue.    In Matthew 23:12, he says this, All who exalt themselves will be humbled and all who humble themselves 
will be exalted,

Humility is key, both for Micah and for Jesus Christ.  It seems that unless there is humility, there is no hope.

Humility is about repentance, that 180 degree turn, when we turn from seeing the world with our eyes and loving it with our 
heart and instead seeing it with God's eyes and loving it with God's heart.  It recognizes our need for God.  It is about 
seeing opportunity, potential, and hope.  

It has two sisters to walk with us in life and in faith, to guide us on our journey.  One of these is watchfulness.  This 
is about waiting and looking for God's presence.  It is about knowing that God is active and alive in our world and working 
out the best of all purposes.  It is about God incarnate in every moment of life, God in selfless love in every moment of 
life, God in life eternal in every moment of life.  It is about knowing that manger cross, and empty tomb are daily, 
heartbeat by heartbeat realities.  And so we wait and we watch.   

You know what I mean.  The phone call with the words you needed to hear. The word from Scripture.  News that people are 
feeding hungry children.  Watch and wait.  You will see God. 

The next step is prayer.  This is about being in God's presence, dreaming God's dreams and seeing God's visions.  It is 
about being encouraged and sustained.  Prayer is that ongoing conversation.  It is us wanting to be in the presence of God, 
of love, of peace, of joy and of hope.

Find your prayer life.  There are many different ways.  Maybe you kneel at your bed every night or contemplate the lilies 
of the field, or something else.  Continue to grow in that ongoing conversation and see what wonders unfold.

If we dance with this spiritual triumvirate, then we will come to know what the   Lord requires of us, and by grace, seek 
to do it, whenever and wherever we are.

Like you, I heard the announcement of tightening of lockdown with some sadness and concern.  We are back within our four 
walls once again.  But, these three friends, humility, watchfulness and prayer, have brought me through another day. 
 
There is hope.  God is still active and engaged with creation.

Seek justice Love kindness.  That is who we are.  Whether within our own four walls, the walls of our churches, or the four 
corners of creation, that is who we are.  And if we dance with the three sisters of humility, watchfulness and prayer, there
will always be hope.  And we will live the words we say.  For this is hope and this is true living.
