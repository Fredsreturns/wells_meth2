Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it.
Hebrews 13:2
If you have read the Epistle to the Hebrews, you know that it was written by someone of a deep faith who was a deep thinker,
and a wonderful preacher.   

The letter is challenging and in some ways difficult for us to understand.  Remember, it was written to a specific group of
people at a specific time with specific issues facing them.  Since the letter contains deep spiritual truths, we still read
it, even though we are not part of those specifics or indeed, fully understand them.

One spiritual truth is about hospitality.  The writer shares all sorts of insights about God, but then says, you now, 
life is a sermon we preach everyday.  And one way we share it is in our hospitality.

It is in sharing a meal together that we share mutual love, whether it be over a cup of tea or a 12 course meal.  It is in 
sharing food that we show our concern and love for one another. There is something wonderful which happens when you share 
a meal.  Before, you can be strangers, but not after. 

You could even say what we eat shows our concern and love for creation as well.  How do we honour the producers and the 
farmers as we share in a meal?  The animals and creations which made it possible?

The thing is that we are called to live our faith in everyday living, just like Sarah and Abraham.  You remember them, 
from the story in Genesis 18:1-15.  They are at Mare, minding their own business, getting on with getting on and three 
strangers show up.  They offer them hospitality, and spoiler alert, turns out they are messengers from God.  

To live hospitality is to open in our daily living to see that of God in the world around us.  It is to see that we are
feasting in hope and in love.  It is to give thanks for there are blessings.  Maybe in the face of restrictions, we cannot
physically offer hospitality.  Maybe we miss that.  Maybe we are going through covid malaise.  Maybe we think that living
faith everyday is difficult from inside four walls.

We can still live hospitality in our heart, for hospitality is about caring for and about others and creation itself.  It
is the insight that life, and faith, is always with, and not for.  For God is with us and we are not alone.
With means we pray.  With means we still care about the world around us.  With means we know we sit at table with God and 
angels and people in all our mixed bag of messiness and wonder.  With means we live with creation.

With means that we live our faith.

I hold you in my prayers and thoughts and in my heart.  For we are with each other and with God.  Let us pray that others
will catch the vision as well.
