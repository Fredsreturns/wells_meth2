Is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?  Acts 1:6

These words ae taken from The Acts of the Apostles, usually called the Book of Acts, or even Acts, for short.  Originally,
it would have been on the same scroll as the Gospel of Luke, as they were written by the same writer and addressed to the
same person, someone named Theopolis.  In the first book, the writer accounts the life and ministry of Jesus, and in the 
second, what Jesus's followers do.

Here, they are confused.  They essentially ask Jesus, Right, now that all the Holy Week and Good Friday and empty tomb 
stuff is over, and what a journey that was, it is all going back to normal.  Right?

And it was a roller coaster that had stretched them so very much.  The three years with Jesus took them way out of their
comfort zone, to use the modern phrase.  They grew through all their experiences and the teachings of Jesus to the point
that they must have felt like very different people to themselves, if not one else.  The world must have seen different 
too.  

And the events of Holy Week, the immediate and real danger with the Romans, the betrayal, the crucifixion, the story of 
an empty tomb of Jesus, and  the appearances of Jesus which confirmed the stories, it has been something of a whirlwind.  
You can appreciate that they would have wanted things to go back to normal.

With any experience which challenges and confuses us, it is the normal human reaction to want things to go back to what
we knew, to what was familiar and comfortable.  The danger is that we retreat to a sentimental nostalgia that has little 
in reality with the past we crave except that it only includes the best bits.  It would be like longing for the days when 
we walked everywhere, but overlooking the blisters.

The disciples are invited to embrace a new understanding and experience of normal.  They are still as linked with God and
one another, just as surely and Luke- Acts linked.  It is a continuum; space-time, here-now, past-present-future.  And 
they are not alone in it.  God still holds them Jesus is still holds them and now, the Holy Spirit will enable them.

The Holy Spirit is Divine inspiration.  The Holy Spirit enables us to see God; hope, love, justice, compassion, active and
present in our world.  It invites us to dance in such lively winds and gives us courage to do so.

It seems to me that is where we are today.  We too, like the disciples, want things to get back to normal.    But what
normal?  For example, we applaud the NHS, and rightly so.   But do we want the blister of its continued underfunding and 
significant shortage of staff and underfunding of staff training and recruitment?  

What we have is the unfolding normal.   It is a continuum and it too changes.  We have the Holy Spirit to both enable to 
see the injustice and the courage to challenge it with love and hope and action.

So, in one way, the answer to the disciples question is , Yes.    It is the kin-dom of all people being treated as 
creatures of value and worth, with dignity and grace.  Yes, the kin-dom has been restored so that even creation itself can 
breathe.  And it is an active political choice.

As the disciples found in Acts, it is in our hands now.
