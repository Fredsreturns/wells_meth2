I am the good shepherd. Says Jesus in John 10.  It is one of my favorite passages It talks about sheep only responding 
to the voice of their shepherd.  It also says that their shepherd loves them, identifies with them, and will be with 
them in all things.

In one of my first sermons in this country, I waxed lyrically on this relationship.  When we got in the 
car there was a long moment of silence.

You really don't know anything about sheep. Do you?  said John.

Now, in my defense, I grew up on the sea and I know whales and icebergs.  Being married to a farmer and agricultural 
journalist has been a real education.

It turns, out that sheep will follow anyone with food.  They make Harry Houdini look like an amateur; if they want out
of their paddock, they will do it. They make cows look like Albert Einstein.  They have no will power and give up in the 
face of any adversity. Or so I have been told.

Then John took me to the Royal Welsh Show.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, we have one breed called the Newfoundland Local
Sheep.  No one really knows where it came from; most likely something left by the Vikings mixed with some long lost 
Welsh breed, is the current thinking.

At the show, there were sheep with badgers faces, sheep with horns, sheep with no horns, big sheep, small sheep, friendly 
sheep, excited sheep, bored sheep, grumpy sheep, international breeds of sheep, and rare breeds.  The variety astounded me. 

Now the image makes sense. 

We are sheep.  Sometimes we have horns and aren't afraid to use them. Sometimes we have no horns at all, and feel the
bruises of life.  Sometimes we feel big, sometimes small.  We too are bored, excited, grumpy.  We too come from all over
the world and are citizens of it.  And sometimes, being people of hope and love and justice, may even make us feel like 
rare breeds indeed.  We too are escape artists and will ignore what we do not want to deal with.  We humans know that 
learning from history is important, but sometimes we too quickly forget. Nor is willpower our greatest strength.  Really.
I gave up making New Years' resolutions years ago. 

We are more like sheep than we want to admit.

It is then both humbling and empowering that the Divine loves us at all.  God wants us to live as people of love, justice,
joy, peace ,compassion and hope.  Even when we feel like the only sheep in the paddock, we are not.  The paddock reaches 
beyond even space and time and is love.

Every Thursday when I share in the applause and banging of pots, I know the paddock is alive.  When people drop cakes off 
on doorsteps, when we greet each other six feet away, when we smile at strangers during the weekly shop, I sense the 
paddock.  Every Sunday, at 10:30, when we gather to pray, I sense the paddock.  The shepherd of hope is in our midst.  
I hope you feel it too.

Continue in prayer.  Continue learning new skills and interests or reembracing ones you have not had time for.  And 
remember that you are held in a paddock of love and hope and the Good Shepherd is with us all.
