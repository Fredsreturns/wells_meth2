Do you remember 01 January 2020?  I do.  I was watching Jools Holland with John, eating a take away curry, 
as we do every year.  Yes, I know, we are just wild and crazy.

As the old of 2019 eased into the of new of 2020, it was with both a poignancy, and a sense of excitement, and more so, 
of hope.  This has been my experience of New Year, year in, year out.

But, I got to tell you, in all my dreams and visions for 2020, to be stopped by something smaller than a mustard seed,
was not the way I dreamt that life would go.  

I come from Newfoundland and Labrador, the land of seemingly endless snowstorms.  We understand cabin fever, 
we even prepare for it.  We know what it is to be cut off from others, sometimes, for a fortnight at a time.  
So my family back home, and myself, are treating this as some sort of months long snowstorm.  But for me and John, 
it is without the snow.  This is one thing we have learnt from being in a contained space with the same people, 
day in day out.  In times of stress, relationships can become fraught.  They may even fray.  People say and do things
out of character.   And remember this; hope, love and grace always sees us through.

Jesus and the disciples knew this.  As followers of the Christian faith, we enter Holy Week and we recall and enter in 
the stories of the events of that week.  Disciples like Peter will betray Jesus, completely out of character. 
The disciples seem not to understand what Jesus is saying, as though their brains go down, which seems odd after all 
they have been through with Jesus.  After all the teachings, preaching, feedings and healings, they seem to simply not
get what is going on.  This too would seem out of character. 

It speaks to their humanness.  The fact that Jesus will later appear to them and invite them to be the bearers of this
Way of justice, love and compassion, of life in its fullness, speaks of God�s grace and love.  God loves and embraces
our very humanness, as a wonderful gift, even when we do not.

In these days, be gentle with yourselves, and each other.  Hold yourselves, and all God�s creatures in the Way of justice, 
love compassion and fullness of life.  Do so in hope and in love.  This is what it means to live the Way in good times and
in challenging ones, and in those we never could have dreamt of. 

Continue to follow the Methodist website for Sunday worship.  Its wisdom in these days is most helpful.  Keep an eye over
one another in love.  Write letters, phone and whatever other technology works for you to remember that your cabin is the
great human family and creation itself.  For as Wesley said,� The whole world is my parish.�  Forgive one another and 
yourself.  Sometimes even we too may act out of character.

In all things remember the words of Paul in Romans 15:13:
�May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the 
Holy Spirit.�
