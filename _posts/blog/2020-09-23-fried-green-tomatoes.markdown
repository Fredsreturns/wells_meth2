I love the book and the movie, Fried Green Tomatoes.  There is one scene where the wonderful Kathy Bates is trying to park 
her car and has the spot pinched by two much  younger women who say,   We are younger and faster,  She responds by banging
into their car and saying,  I am older and I have more insurance.
 
I have been in ministry for about 30 years now and I realize that I am closer in age to Kathy Bates than the two younger 
women.  I too am older, I too have more insurance and I think some wisdom. 
 
This much I know. I am not alone God is with me.  There is good and the potential for good.  As a result of this insight, I
can and should have a go.  I know that I have friends, and sisters and brothers in the faith and in the heart, who will 
have a go as well.  I know that I am called to be a child of God, and to be about justice and righteousness, peace and love
 and joy and hope, and that Jesus Christ , in manger, cross and empty tomb, shows us the way. 
 
I know that this way is open to anyone who would wish to embark on the journey and that together, as  we have a go, we will 
embrace our own liberation, encourage others to embrace theirs and see what wonders there are. 
 
I know all of this because on my journey of faith, which began even more than 30 years ago, in a church perched on the side
of the sea, surrounded by my parents  and grandparents, aunties and uncles, cousins and friends.   
 
They helped me to see this truth.  Belief is a verb, not a noun, and faith is an activity, not a possession. 
 
Belief is active and dynamic.  It is change even as it inspires change.  Belief seeks to be about justice and peace and
love and hope, wherever and however we are.  In times of challenge and injustice, pandemic and peace, it dances and dreams, 
hopes and encourages, and sustains all things. 
 
Faith is not a possession.  It is not mine and mine alone.  It is an activity; it is how we live.  There is no point in
knowing that I am a child of love and liberation and hope, if I do not live it that others might catch the vision as well.
 What is the adage?  If one of us hungers, we all hunger.  Faith is the activity that says all should have food and enough
and be fully free to be the children of God they were created to be. 
 
My family, from my infancy, lived and witnessed to this way in their everyday living, and still do.  In our joys and 
struggles, in the dignity and grace of getting on with getting on they had a go at making the world a better place, whether
they knew it or not.  And still are.  
 
So, as an older and wiser woman, with more insurance, thanks to my Dad, the insurance broker, I have this assurance.  It
sustains me well, in this verb and activity way of life.  I pray it sustains you as well. 
 
 
Blessings and Peace
