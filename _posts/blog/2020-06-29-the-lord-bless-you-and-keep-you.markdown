Numbers 6:24-26 New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)

> 24 The LORD bless you and keep you;
> 25 the LORD make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you;
> 26 the LORD lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.

This blessing is well known to us all.  We use it often in church.  We love it for its sense of peace and assurance.
It is a beloved blessing of Jews and Christians alike.
It is a blessing of the ages.  It is known as the Aaronic blessing as it would have been used by the Hebrew priests
since long ago.  Archaeologists have found two silver cylinders from the period of the First Temple with this 
blessing inscribed on them.  They date from 600BCE, meaning the blessings would have been ancient even when Jesus 
was a little child.

The blessing itself is special, using poetic Hebrew language and structure.  In Hebrew, the first line contains
three words, the second, five words and the third seven.  This suggests a flow, the flow of God's blessing, spoken 
by a single voice, growing ever wider, to encompass and envelope all.  

The blessing uses the image of light.  Light means clarity, revelation, the warmth of sunshine and love, rescue 
from cold darkness, renewing of life and of joy.  It is about the very face of the Divine shining, nay beaming, 
with love, joy, peace, and hope to all creation. 

The blessing ends with peace, or Shalom. Shalom is God's will for all; for everyone and creation itself.  Shalom is 
about longevity, happiness in relationships, safety, security, good health, friendship, righteousness, and justice. 
It is God's ultimate word.  It is God's prayer and wish for all people and creation itself.

We live in interesting times.  We seem to be living hobbit-like, each in our own homes, for the greater good, 
because of a virus we cannot see.  Some of us are taking tentative, anxious steps as we move out of lockdown, while 
others are saying, and have been saying, 'Rules?  What rules?'

Others have been inviting us to dream new dreams and see new visions, what a post lockdown world might look like.  For
some, this invitation has been unsettling and scary and has been met with resistance.  Others have caught the vision and
taken the knee.  

God, in one voice, still speaks this blessing over all.  Shalom.  For thousands of years, God breathes this vision over us
all, and creation itself.  We receive it as we need, for God knows us better than we do.  It may be comfort, inspiration, 
affirmation, or challenge, but in all things, this blessing is hope.  

And like a crescendo, it reverberates though out the ages.  

As we as church embrace this post lockdown world, for some there will be relief, for others anxiety.  Some will find the 
restrictions onerous, like no singing and social distancing, while others will find them a comfort.  Still others will 
still battle fears.

And the work of the servant church continues, as we call for and work for justice in our world.

Over all God calls for and commands and is Shalom.  May we be agents of it.
