Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy Exodus 20:8
 
Then Jesus said, The Sabbath was made for humankind, not humankind for the Sabbath.  Mark 2:27

What is your memory of Sabbath?  There was a time when we took the Sabbath, the day of rest, quite seriously.  As 
Christians, we honoured it Sunday, the day of Jesus resurrection, as a witness that we are a people of hope, of new life, 
of liberating justice.

For some, it became a restrictive day, not a liberating one.  No work, obviously, but also a lot of other things.   No 
music, no playing, no laughing, no games, no artistic outlets like knitting, because that could be seen as work.

It is unfortunate, because the point of Sabbath is to give us all time to recall and remember.  It was intended for us to 
remember that we are not called to be units of production nor being merely consumers, but instead, human beings.  We were 
not to designed to be people of anxiety, but hope and liberating love and justice.  It was time to recall that no 
injustice, whether economic or political has the final say.  God's way of justice, kindness and mercy does.

To witness to this, we are told in Scripture that even God rested.  And remembered and continued creating.

The virus, as wretched as it has been, has made us take Sabbath, and maybe even reclaim it.  In this time, we have found 
the space to remember what is really important.  Community.  Caring for one another.  Caring for the earth.  Nurturing 
relationships.  Remembering who we are and why we are.  It has not ignored the challenging narrative we live in, but has 
given us the space to see the hope, dancing and lively, in its lines.

We have read and learnt new skills.  We have embraced theater and music.  We have learnt new ways of being church.  We 
have remembered the beautiful fragility of life and rose to protect it by sewing scrubs and applauding frontline workers, 
for example.

Sabbath has liberated us to be more fully human than many of us could have ever imagined.    

The question is, how do we continue?

Already, there are conversations and comments about people getting back to both working and consuming.  Do not get me 
wrong. We need to work.  However, it is God's will that work should be of meaning and purpose and not work which demeans 
and dehumanizes.  And, in this time of Sabbath, many of us have come to see that we do not need to be full time consumers.

Sabbath helps us to see that we all need rest to remember, humans and creation.  We need time to reflect, create and work
for justice and peace.  Sabbath gives us time and space to dream dreams and see visions.

We need Sabbath, whether we realize it or not.  We need to dance in its liberating space to be fully human, fully members
of the human family, fully part of creation.

Where do we go from here?

One day we will look at other people and ask the question, Where were you during the virus?   We will tell stories of 
what we did and how things were.  We will tell stories about how the experience shaped us and the new normal.

That is the thing.  This too shall pass and things will get back to normal.  But, it will be a new normal.  And we must 
own our voice in the shaping of that new normal.

I pray that new normal will always include sabbath rest, the time to remember, reflect and live liberating justice and 
love.
