But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its 
welfare you will find your welfare. Jeremiah 29:7.
These words were written by the Prophet Jeremiah on the occasion of the Babylonian exile and captivity.  You know the one,
even Boney M sang about it.  By the Rivers of Babylon, there we sat down How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange 
land?  This song, in turn, is based on Psalms 19 and 137, but then you knew that.

The people had been overwhelmed by the forces of Nebuchadnezzar 2, the greatest power of the day.  He destroyed Jerusalem,
the temple and exiled the people from the Promised Land.  It must have felt like Adam and Eve being turned out of the 
garden of Eden all over again. Most prophets preached something along these lines.  No worries. 
This is a mere blip.  God will have us back in Jerusalem before the week is out and that old Nebbie will have such a 
bloody nose.  You can just imagine how popular Jeremiah was with this insight.  Not only would the people be in exile 
for some time, God wanted them to pray for old Nebbie and his people, that great military and political superpower of the 
day, and wish them the best. 

The core of what Jeremiah is saying is this.  We are called to live in profoundly deep and real relationship, with God 
and all God's creatures, wherever and however we are.  To do this is life for us, for to be about God is to be about God's 
ways, which are justice, love, compassion and hope.  This is life for all.  Life is not about us and them.  Rather, it is
about us; God and all creatures.  You might say, But it says here, where I have sent you into exile, and yes,
that is what is says.  But a more helpful reading of it is where I go with you.  God who is justice, love, compassion 
and love does not stop loving any more than a parent could who sends a child off to their room.  They go with them.

To not live this relational way, this way of mutuality, does not turn out well; Jeremiah has a lot to say about that as
well. The message is clear. Trust in God's vision of shalom and God's way of justice, love, compassion and hope and live
it every day, wherever you find yourself in life.  For only in relationship with the divine and all God's creatures,
can we truly live. 

As we come to see that we are in for the long haul in the days of the coronavirus, we may come to feel as though we are 
in exile, enthralled to a power even superior than Nebuchadnezzar. But let us not give into despair. God is with us in
this. God is with me in my room as I type this, listen to the birds and hold you in my heart. God is with me as I look at
my supplies and think of all the people and animals that made them possible and compel me to honour them by not wasting
any of it. 

God is with me as I pray for and with you. God is present and so there is no exile, only another way of living, and we 
are still one. This too shall pass. In the meantime, let us pray for and with one another.  Keep sending in your books
and movies, and past times new, or rediscovered, interests.  Especially, send in your worship and devotional resources.

And thank you all for your ministry and witness in these days. You are more than gracious. 

Let us continue to seek the welfare of all God's creatures, and pray for one another, 
for in the wellbeing of each other, we will find our own.  For God is with us and we are not alone.
