My lyre has arrived
I can see why David found it encouraged and enabled him to connect with his higher self and with God.  
Remember king David in the Bible?  He was the mighty warrior, slayer of enemies, and also devoted servant of God.  
The two parts of him must have rested uneasily within him.  His lyre, his music, was his worship of God, and helped him to
connect with his higher self.
Here in 1 Chronicles 16, we have David bringing the Ark of the covenant into the Temple.  This is a huge moment in his 
people's history.  God is in the Temple. Or, in other words, God is home and having an open house for us all. If you 
haven't read the chapter, it is good stuff. 

In this section of this song of praise and celebration, the people take centre stage.

Then on that day David first appointed the singing of praises to the LORD by Asaph and his kindred.
8 O give thanks to the LORD, call on his name,
    make known his deeds among the peoples.
9 Sing to him, sing praises to him,
    tell of all his wonderful works.
10 Glory in his holy name;
    let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
11 Seek the LORD and his strength,
    seek his presence continually.
12 Remember the wonderful works he has done,
    his miracles, and the judgments he uttered,
13 O offspring of his servant Israel,[b]
    children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

It is the people who are called to live the Good News that we are not alone that God is with us.   Yes, God is in our midst,
but if the people who now are invited to live as a breathing, witnessing dynamic people of God, to be a living Temple, as 
it were.
We too are a living, breathing, witnessing, dynamic people of God. Notices outside our churches may well say closed and 
will do so for the foreseeable future.  However, God is with us and the invitation is still to be a living, breathing, 
dynamic, witnessing church, however and wherever we are.
Has been ever thus.  In these strange times, it has taken on a new urgency.
So, what should our notices be saying?   This site closed, but the service goes on.? Or how about, We are worshipping 
in new and exciting ways.  Come join us.?  Or, the whole world is our parish.?
Maybe you can think of another.
We are the church, because God is with us, just as surely as the Ark was in the Temple.  We can rejoice and make music 
with the lyres of our hearts and faith.  In all things, in riots and hungry children, in sickness and in health, in the
face of injustice and fear, we will sing the song of God, of justice, love, liberation and hope.  We do so with walls and 
beyond them.

Indeed, the whole world is our parish.   

Let us live verse 34,
Then all the people said, Amen!, and they praised the Lord.
