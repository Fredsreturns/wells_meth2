title: Walls that Divide

One of my favorite hymns is:  Walls that Divide, written by Rev. Walter Farquharson. 
 
This is the refrain: Walls that divide are broken down; Christ is our unity!  Chains that enslave are thrown aside; Christ 
is our liberty! 
 
This is Good News.  By God's grace, we are called to proclaim it every day. How do you do that when you are tired.?  We 
want to see one another, be with one another.  It is hard to rouse up the energy to call and email as we did so many weeks
ago. 
 
Further, events in the world are deeply upsetting.    I thought that after Nelson Mandela walked free, things would get
better.  When the Berlin wall came down, I wept with joy and disbelief and thought things will only get better. 
 
The question is do we have the energy and vision to proclaim that Christ and Christ's way, is still our liberty and unity?  
 
Take Black Lives matter. In some quarters all lives matter is used as a counterpoint to it.   I struggle with that because
can only really use that phrase if you back it up with action. 
 
Think about it this way. If all lives matter, then why are women still paid less than men?  If all lives matter, then then
why are people in poverty villainized?  If all lives matter, why can't people around the world, love who they need?  If
all lives matter, then why is there a class system?  If all lives matter, why do we need a Black Lives Matter movement at 
all? 
 
People, it's rubber meets the road time.  Put your money where your mouth is time.  Say what you do and do what you say.  
 
As Christians, we are called to be agents of change, of hearts and minds and souls.  We are called to be the hands and 
feet of Jesus Christ, of compassion, justice love and hope. We need to be clear on the Gospel we hold and speak truth to 
power. 
 
Its been a long haul; 12 weeks of lockdown and at least 2000 years since Jesus called us to live justice- love. 
 
Call to mind these words 
 
'but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run 
and not be weary, they shall walk and not be faint' Isaiah 40:31 
 
Or how about this one? 'You have seen what I have dome to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagle's wings and brought 
you to myself.'  Exodus 19:4 
 
My sisters and brothers, keep the faith.  Keep courage in the Good News of Christ which has set you free.  Keep living, 
sharing and serving for the Kingdom of God, in the wonder of daily living, in the dignity and grace of getting on with 
getting on. Wherever God has called you to be, remember whose you are and why you are. Remember that Christ and Christ's 
way of compassion, justice love and hope and liberty and unity for all.  For if even one more heart is strangely warmed 
and injustice makes it weep, then the world is already a different place.  And walls will and do come down.
