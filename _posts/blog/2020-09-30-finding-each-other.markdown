title: Finding Each Other

Since being here, I have had to renew my passport at Canada House in London.

I took a number and waited my turn.  Since John and I are larks and had gotten into London at o'clock in the morning, we
were first in the queue and anticipating a lovely day off.

The staff were facing a far different day.  The room was choc a block with Canadians all waiting patiently with their
 numbers, to have their issues dealt with.

My number was called.   The clerk behind the wicket says to me, Says on your passport you were born in Corner Brook.  I 
knew a Cheryl and a Rebecca

They would be my cousins

And Dereck and Cathy?

My Uncle and Auntie.

And every other Canadian in the queue was muttering.  Newfs.  You must sniff each other out.

I don't know if it is the way we carry ourselves, or the lit of the speech, the laughter or the turn of phrase, but
Newfoundland and Labradorians do tend to find each other out, in the most unlikely of places.   Whether it be Dad in the 
Hall of Mirrors, at Versailles, or me meeting people from home in a supermarket in Wells, we tend to find each other out.

As we live in these interesting times, we too might feel alone.  You may feel as though you are the only one tired, or who
longs for justice or want to have a go at making things better.

Maybe you feel alone for another reason.  As we journey in our faith life, it seems to be a part of it.  I have discovered
this. Like being a stranger in a strange land, there are more of you floating about than you realize and you will find each 
other out. 

How do we recognize each other, in the era of masks and double speak regulations and unrest?  How are we able, as those
exasperated, bemused and impressed Canadians asked, able to sniff each other out?

Listen to these words from Paul in his letter to the Galatians.

"By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness and self-control"
 
To understand that we are more an inner woven web of life and less a self- contained island will impact on how we all live 
our lives.  That's when the whole, love, peace, patience, generosity, faithfulness and self-control, are lived. 

There is no law, nor regulation, nor mask, nor anything else, which can stop us from catching this vision.   And like 
Newfoundland and Labradorians, a long away from home, you will find others who embrace this vision.

Let us pray that others will continue to embrace this way.  Let us pray for those in authority that they do as well.  And
let us work and serve that all creation will catch the vision.  For we are not alone.  There are lots of like hearted 
people around, and there is always God's love and grace.
