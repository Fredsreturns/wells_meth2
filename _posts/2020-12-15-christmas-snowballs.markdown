Our soul waits for the Lord, God is our help and shield.  Psalm 33:20 
 
Christmas is not Christmas without my mother's snowballs.  They are trufflelike treats that my family have loved ever since I can remember.  Mum would make a batch and we would devour them as we decorated the tree, had family and friends around, or just by ourselves. 

I took out the recipe and baulked.  The portions seemed huge.  And then I looked at the yield.  Three and a half dozen would be a lot for us to consume, even for John, an epic chocolate fiend.  So maybe a half batch this year.  

I could make them every day if I wished, but there is something in their every specialness, in the memories that they evoke, that means I only make them once a year.  I eat them and enjoy the memories.  Those I shared them with in the past, still dance in my midst.  And they are a promise, that next year, I will make another batch, or two, and share with family and friends once again. 

Waiting can be a real gift in our spiritual journey.  It invites us to remember all that has been, reflect on where we are, and know that our hope is real.  This is our confidence and our joy. 
Mary, and Joseph, knew confidence and joy.  They would have taken it from this Psalm reading, which they would have known very well.  It is a hymn of praise, rejoicing that our trust and hope in God, and in God's way, are confident and sure.
 
Maybe they called it to mind under the light of a star.  And in the remembering, recalled all who had placed their confidence in God in the past, and prayed for all who would do so in the future.  For they knew that praise is the response in life to the hope and trust we place in God and God in us.   

Mary and Joseph lived this in their waiting for the Messiah to come, in their waiting for the Babe to be born, in their waiting for God's Way to be fully known.  When they held all that in their arms, the fulfilment of their waiting became all the sweeter.  

It is a simple thing then; don't rush the snowballs.  The taste of them, once a year, becomes intensely chocolately and deliciously sweet and huge in number. It becomes a reminder that when all is completed, and God's Way is fully known, the waiting will be fulfilled and it will be sweet days indeed. 
In our waiting, let this insight offer us hope and confidence and even joy, that we might trust in God's Way and live it, every day, wherever and however we are.  It was what Mary and Joseph trusted in and how they lived, in glorious times and challenging ones.  And when their waiting was fulfilled, it set them, and all creation free.  Thanks be to God. Amen. 
 
Beatrice's snowballs 
1 c sugar 
7 tbsp cocoa (more if you are a real chocoholic, less if not) 
1/2c milk 
1/2c butter 
3 c rolled oats  
1c coconut 
1tbsp vanilla 
1/4tsp salt 
 
Put sugar and cocoa and milk in a saucepan.  Stir over low heat until sugar dissolves.  Bring to boil.  Add butter and oats.  Stir briskly and cook for 1-2mins, stirring constantly.  Remove from heat.
 
Add vanilla and salt and mix.   When cool enough to handle, form into balls with teaspoon.  Drop into coconut and roll to fully cover.  Leave to cool on baking sheet; they will firm up as they cool. 

Should make 3 dozen.
