We live in interesting times.  Our rhythms of life are altered.  How we relate to one another has changed.
Some of us are fearful for ourselves and loved ones.  While others feel that they ought to carry on as they pretty much
always have and find all this something of a nuisance but will do as we are instructed.  Some of us, no doubt,
are somewhere in-between.

It is indeed odd that something smaller than mustard seed, has so profoundly impacted on our lives.
And that is the point.  It has impacted on all our lives.  All creatures of our God and king, as the hymn goes, 
are touched by these days. The distinctions of us and them, of friend and stranger, are shown to be empty and untrue.  
We all live  under the same sun, feel the same rushing wind are sustained by the same flowing water,  
and need warmth and light.  The question is how do we make music, for our God to hear and in it, praise God?

We do so how we live and to what we witness.  We  know that the dualities of us and them, friend and stranger are false.  
We are all creatures of God.  Nor is this a choice; it is the way God created us to be.  We can accept that reality or 
deny it, but it is the way God created us to be.  Why else would the angels sing 

> Glory to God in the highest heaven and 
> peace on earth to all which God favours and loves?

Continue to look over one another in love.  Follow the advice of the Methodist Church and the Government.  
Both websites are really useful.  The District Facebook page is also very useful.

Let us, as a sign of our common creatureliness, stop every Sunday at 10:30, and pray.  Maybe for you, it will be silence, 
maybe the Lord' Prayer, maybe something else.  But in this act of prayer, bear witness to our God and to all whom 
God loves. For this virus might be as small as a mustard seed, but we have faith in a God of compassion, love an hope.

> For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move from here 
to there and it will move.  An nothing will be impossible for you. -- Matthew 17:20
