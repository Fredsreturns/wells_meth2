Zechariah 9:9-12

> The Coming Ruler of God's People

> 9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion!

>    Shout aloud, O daughter Jerusalem!

> Lo, your king comes to you;

>    triumphant and victorious is he,

> humble and riding on a donkey,

>    on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

> 10 He[a] will cut off the chariot from Ephraim

>    and the war-horse from Jerusalem;

> and the battle bow shall be cut off,

>    and he shall command peace to the nations;

>  his dominion shall be from sea to sea,

>    and from the River to the ends of the earth.

> 11 As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you,

>    I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.

> 12 Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope;

>    today I declare that I will restore to you double.


This passage is well known to us in the church.  We use it most often on Palm Sunday when we rejoice that Jesus comes into
Jerusalem.
Even by the time Jesus was a lad, over 2000 years ago, this would have been well known, in fact, it was ancient even by
Jesus' time.  It speaks of the Kin-dom of God, the Way of God, the realm of God, the Kingdom of God.  It is a time of such
peace, that even war horses and chariots, and battle bows have gotten their P45 and are no more.

However, before this passage, we have images of God as Divine warrior, wreaking havoc on any and all enemies.  We don't 
like those passages very much and they don't seem to get as much airtime.  But I think they should.
First, it speaks to the human condition.  We want peace, all of us, but in the face of such injustice, what do you do?

To paint God as the ultimate warrior is actually about hope.  It is to say, 'Let me tell you.  You think your unjust regime,
your abuse of power, your attitude of us and them is all that and a bag of crisps?  Let me tell you, God is way more 
powerful than that and God's way will have the final say.  And in case you don't know, it is the way of peace justice and
love and will have dominion from sea to sea.'

And I say testify.

Evil must be actively resisted and done away with.  It does not disappear by itself.  Wesley knew that when he spoke out
about slavery.  Methodists resisted evil when we chose not to eat sugar made on slave plantations.

We resisted evil and continue to do so, a) because we are Christians and Methodists and b) because we know that God and
God's way of Shalom, of peace and harmony, is the supreme force, final ownership and ultimate authority.  God is both 
supreme power and supreme love.  And this is our hope.

Last year at the Glastonbury Music Festival, I had the great privilege to listen to the wonderful Mavis Staples.  In one of
her songs, she sang about the evils of the world, like children with knives and in then sang, 'We got work to do.'
We do.  We got work to do.  And we do so knowing that God is with us and we are not alone.
