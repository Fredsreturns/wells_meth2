The Prophet Micah said this, in Micah 6:8  

God has told you, O mortal what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, 
and to walk humbly with your God?

That is, it.  Now that doesn't seem to hard does it?

In this, we rely on God's grace.  There are times when we get it right and others, not so much.  God's grace, the insight
that we are fully 100% sinner and fully 100% saint fully 100% of the time, and God still loves us, is our hope.

God just wants us to grow and learn from life, from the wonderful experiences and the ones that are less so.  God wants us
to grow ever deeper in life, in love, in what it means to be fully human and fully alive, in all that we experience.  God 
wants us to live fully, not fearfully, seeking justice and kindness. So, God came in Jesus Christ, in manger, cross and 
empty tomb.

Humility is key, both for Micah and our Saviour and Friend, Jesus Christ. Humility is about repentance, that 180 degree
turn, when we turn from seeing the world with our eyes and loving it with our heart and instead seeing it with God's eyes 
and loving it with God's heart. It sees the endless possibilities and opportunities. It recognizes our need for God.  

It has two friends to walk with.  One of these is watchfulness.  This is about waiting and looking for God's presence.  It
is about knowing that God is active and alive in our world and working out the best of all purposes.  It is about God 
incarnate in every moment of life, God in selfless love in every moment of life, God in life eternal in every moment of 
life.  It is about knowing that manger cross, and empty tomb are daily, heartbeat by heartbeat realities.  Sometimes God's 
presence comes in a word, a hug, a bird swopping in air, a child's laugh and we know.     

The next step is prayer.  This is about being in God's presence, dreaming God's dreams and seeing God's visions.  It is
about being encouraged and sustained.  Prayer is that ongoing conversation.  It is us wanting to be in the presence of God,
of love, of peace, of joy and of hope.

If we dance with this spiritual triumvirate, then we will come to do what the Lord requires of us.

That is why I wear a mask.  I know it is a palaver and I keep forgetting so I now have multiples; one in the car and
another in purse at all times and one on my face.  I do so because I want to be kind to others and I seek a just world 
where all are safe.  I seek to live the love that sets us all free. 

As we continue in these days, let us embrace once again this way of being.  Let us seek as Jesus , and  Micah before him reminded us to do.

Seek justice, love kindness and walk humbly with one another and with God.
