Do all the good you can.  By all the means you can.  In all the ways you can.  In all the places you can.  To all the
people you can.  As long as ever you can. 
John Wesley.

As we sit in our home, John and I have been reflecting on this.  I don't suppose Mr Wesley had such days in mind, but 
the message remains.  Wherever we are, however we are, we are called to still live our faith.

Faith is about living in solidarity with those who suffer.  It is about witnessing to hope. Faith is the assurance of
things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen, as we are told in Hebrews 11:1.  It is to live the alls of
Mr. Wesley.

John and I went out in our garden and banged pots and pans to show our support for the NHS.  We felt like real dolts
at first, because we were the only ones.  And I thought, maybe we are the only ones who have faith that hope is alive.
Maybe we are the only ones who have faith in those who seek to serve humanity in the NHS.  Maybe we are the only ones
who have faith that this too shall pass.

And then we could hear it.  Hands clapping.  Pots and pans banging, in a crescendo of faith.
Faith and hope and love are infectious, you see, and when caught, overcomes all else.  Easter tells us this.  The tomb
is empty to the skies.  Dance in its light. And pass it on.

We are called to live Easter every day. When this is over, and this too shall pass, let us continue to support those 
who have supported us through this time.   Let us not forget the things we have discovered or rediscovered, during this
time, that justice, hope and love, decency and compassion are the things which enable and encourage us to be all that
God created us to be.

Please then, pray for the NHS, the church, the police, fire service, postal workers, bin and other environmental workers,
farmers, food bank volunteers, all volunteers, the military, shop workers and all who seek to serve humanity.  And, 
after all this is over, let us not forget.

On a personal note, please pray for the people of Nova Scotia, who on top of trying to figure out these strange days, 
have another aberration to deal with.  Let us continue to live our faith as Mr Wesley encouraged us, wherever and however
we are.  Let us continue to pray for and with one another.  Continue to send in the stories of what you are doing and 
reading that we might build each other up.  For we are not alone.  God is with us.

Thanks be to God.
