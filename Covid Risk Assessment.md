Review comments
Purpose
This review covers the use of the church by the Congregation for the purposes of opening the church for worship services.  It has been agreed that the congregation should start to use the church building again before other users are permitted.   Other users will be expected to carry out their own risk assessments which are to be submitted and approved by the church leadership group and the superintendent minister.  These other assessments will be checked to ensure that they are in line with this assessment. 

Social Distancing
Areas for where distancing will be more difficult
	Vestry
	Kitchen
	Toilets
	Corridors
	Entrance vestibule
	Cloakroom


Mitigations
We have three doors at the front of the building.  – A one way system discussed, it was agreed that best approach to maintain distancing would actually be to say use same door to exit as you used for entrance, this along with doors being kept open when services are happening. 
People are to be encouraged by welcoming team not to hang around in the entrances but to go into the main building. 
Unless weather precludes welcoming people to be outside the building.
Internal doors to be on latches open where fitted. 
2M floor marking not considered being of benefit, but good signage to be provided.  Signs will include:
	Maintain safe distance (2M).
	Do not use – for various items – more details below.
	Wash hands 
	One person only in room
	Two people only in room
Brian to produce/obtain appropriate signs.
Action Brian
Hand sanitiser will be provided at doors, in vestry.   Tissues will also be provided – in the Vestry.
Face coverings are to be worn whilst in the building, except for people that have exceptions.  for areas where 2m distancing cannot be maintained.
First aid kit is in the kitchen, this will be supplemented with additional PPE for use by the church first aiders (Note that this has been provided as of 18th July).
Chairs will be moved to the back of the main building with the exception of those that can be used.  Chairs to be placed in pairs for use during the service with 2m distance between the pairs.  Twenty pairs of chairs will be provided, assuming that we are permitted up to 30 people for any service and assuming half of these will be in household groups that do not need to maintain social distancing. 
After services no refreshments will be served, but people can stay in the main area to ‘socialise’ whiles maintaining physical distancing.  It was suggest that people may wish to bring their own drinks if they want one.

Cleaning
The cleaning job description to be reviewed to ensure appropriate cleaning is included.
An additional checklist / guidance note will be provided to cover any specific activities
Action Janet
Specifics to be added for cleaning
	Wiping door handles. 
	Chairs
	Light Switches
	Projector button
Wiping surfaces

It was agreed that no screens would be needed to separate people.
It was agreed that no structural changes to the building, the building is listed, but no impact.
If anyone does become ill during a service additional cleaning will be required.  The Cleaner will be instructed to do this following any such incident.

Specific rooms
Toilets
The hand driers are to be disabled, fuses removed.
The Gents Urinal is to be not used and taped off, - so the door to the room can be wedged open
Hand towels will be provided, but stacked so that one can be used without touching the whole pile.
One person only to be in each of the toilets at any one time. i.e. one gentleman and one lady.
The toilet in the vestry will only be for use by the preacher. – So only one person allowed in the room.

Kitchen
Refreshments will not be served after services.  The kitchen will only be used for access for essentials e.g.:
	Getting water for preacher
	First aid
	Communion resources.
(Post meeting note:  We could suggest that the preacher brings their own water if they would feel more comfortable with this.)
The entrance to the kitchen will only be via the hall and not the corridor.  
Only 1 person to be in the Kitchen at any one time.
Upstairs Rooms
The back upstairs room will not be used for meetings.
The office will be subject to separate arrangements by the circuit staff.

Hall
The hall will not be available for use initially, Specifially, the piano is not to be used and a sign will be added to this effect.
Cloak Room,
This room will not be used.
Corridor between main room and hall 
For access to the toilets, this corridor will be a one way system implemented from the front to the rear of the building.  Return via the main church room.
One person permitted in the corridor at any time.
Vestry
Two people permitted.  This will allow the preacher and steward to meet for prayer.
Prayer Chapel 
Two people permitted.  This area is to be used in an emergency if someone becomes ill and cannot leave to go home immediately due to being collected after the service.

Main ‘church’
A maximum of 30 people will be permitted in the main church room.  Chairs will be set out to maintain social distancing, in pairs to allow households to sit together.

Outside the building
The welcoming team will greet people outside of the building unless it is raining. People will be encouraged to move straight into the building and not hang around outside, also the welcoming team will encourage all to maintain social distancing.
Specific Roles
Welcoming team
The welcoming team to be outside if possible.  The welcoming team will record people’s names and phone numbers and emails.  This will be retained for 3 weeks.  The team will let people know that they should contact Steve Stoodley if they become ill for tracking and tracing.  Steve to coordinate passing information to Track and Trace.  We will not carry out additional tracing ourselves.
The team will tell people they can take a hymnbook / order of service if really needed, but advise to use the screen if at all possible.   At the end of the service, any books used will be separated for 72 hours minimum.
A ‘register’ of regular attendees will be generated and provided to the welcome team so we will just have to ‘tick’ them on the list.  Visitor’s details will need to be collected.
Stewards
Normal duties apply, will still light candle.
Will sanitise microphones and lectern before and after the service.
Will sanitise door handles and secure doors open where possible.
Hymn numbers can be displayed, only the steward is to touch the numbers, ensuring appropriate sanitisation is carried out. 

Media / Organ
Media operator and organist will be responsible to sanitise the media area and instruments before and after use.
Note that there will be no singing during the services although music may be played via the media system and on the organ/piano.

Minister / Preacher
Normal duties apply.
Encourage not to touch lectern microphone.


Other activities
Communion 
Minister will hand bread to communicants.  We use individual glasses for wine so not an issue.  The Communion stewards to ensure appropriate sanitation of all items used.  It was noted that the 2 people who normally do this have underlying health conditions so may not be happy to continue with this roll.  Alternative arrangements may need to be made via the duty steward.
The offering
A plate will be left at the back of the church to receive any offerings. These will then be left in the vestry for a minimum of 72 hours before being counted/banked.  
Post meeting note:  This could be done with gloves and placed in a sealed container though banking should wait the three days.


Flowers
It was agreed that we do not have a fresh flower arrangement each week.  Possibly a plant will be placed on the flower stand.  Steve to discuss / agree with Mo Joyce.
Action Steve

Dissemination of Information
The distribution of information will be maintained by the weekly emails.  Martin Harrington will be asked to continue to do this.  For those without email access Chris Hitt will ensure that the information via the pastoral leaders route.
Prior to opening the building for worship announcements will be sent out using the above methods to ensure that people will know what to expect and what will be expected from them.
Anyone who reports symptoms during a service will be asked to go straight home to isolate.  If it is not possible for them to do so during the service – i.e. because they are being picked up at the end, they are to go to the prayer chapel.  When they do leave an extra sanitisation of the prayer chapel.  Track and Trace will be informed of their details.
People will be asked to inform the church (via Steve Stoodley) if they become ill after attending the church building.  Steve will inform track and trace.
This risk assessment and any subsequent changes will be published on the church website.
