As a church we work to serve people in the same way as Jesus serves us. Behind the scenes so many people are doing simple things. 

From making cakes, to preparing the hall, cleaning the the loos, to meeting with, and comforting people. You may not know who's doing it, but someone always is.

> "Everyone is so friendly here, and everyone does their part"

We are part, not only of the Methodist family of churches, but also the community of local churches. Involved in the Christians Together in Wells.

> "Belonging to a church is belonging to the wider Christian Community"

We are involved in a number of activities throughout the week to support and encourage each other in Jesus.
