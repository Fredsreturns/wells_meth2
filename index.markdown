Welcome to the Wells Methodist Church. We are a community of people, following Jesus, and his example. Serving God and his people in the ways we each can.

We are a member of the [Methodist Church](https://www.methodist.org.uk)

As part of the Methodist Church we are part of it's calling:

> "The calling of the Methodist Church is to respond to the gospel of God's love in Christ and to live out its discipleship in worship and mission.
> Through Worship, Service, Learning and Caring, and Evangelism"

Within that, we are members of the [Mendip Methodist Circuit](http://www.somersetmethodists.org/) Encouraging discipleship.

And we are part of the larger body of christ.

Do come and get it touch. We are a friendly bunch, and I promise we don't bite.

For Communion services the Methodist Communion is an "Open Table"  -  all who share the Christian faith are welcome to receive the bread and non-alcoholic wine which is included in our services once a month.  

Baptisms, weddings and funerals can be arranged with the Minister.  

We are doing our bit for the climate/environment by recycling all we can and trying to be as plastic-free as possible.
