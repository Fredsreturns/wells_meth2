* Healing Services, again once a quarter.

After the service - as well as tea and coffee - members of the prayer ministry team are always available to pray with you.

## Monthly Evening services

Informal evening services, usually a discussion based around a DVD are held once a month, usually the second Sunday at 6:30.  

After the morning service there is plenty of time to get to know each other over tea and biscuits and often some lovely cakes from our team of volunteers.
